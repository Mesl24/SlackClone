# SlackClone

This time i challenged myself and choosed an intermediate website to clone, i chose Slack.com


It get's me 4 days to finish it from the very begining to the last piece of this webpage.

I made this page with pure HTML and CSS, no Bootstrap or any other CSS framework,
my purpose of not using any framework for designing is to give myself a chance and to challenge my self
to became a CSS "MONSTER" and guess what, i'm that guy !

This website is responsive with the help of @meta "PURE" (faced a lot of struggle to finish this part)

Unfortunately, this website is not interactive yet (No JavaScript is used), but who knows?
Maybe in the near future i'll make it interactive.

Dont forget to try it on your mobile to see how it will looks like.
